# SMS Test App

This little app is to demonstrate how to use an API and store and receive data form a remote MySQL database.

I decided to NOT use the following:
- Visual Studio IDE
- Entity Framework

I will use all FREE services and apps like:
- Visual Studio Code
- remotemysql.com (a free mysql hosting service)
- .Net Core CLI
- Bootstrap 4
- Jquery 3.3.1

## Running the app
1. Clone the repo locallay
2. Go into the project directory
3. run the following commands
```
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
dotnet add package MySql.Data
dotnet run
```
4. Open up a browser and navigate to https://localhost:5001/
